      <h2>About Mental Health</h2>
      <div class="content-grid">
        <p>Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.<br> <br>At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances – including poverty, violence, disability and inequality – are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition. <br><br> Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world. Mental health care is often poor in quality when delivered. People with mental health conditions often also experience stigma, discrimination and human rights violations. Despite its importance, stigma and lack of awareness still hinder access to care. Our mission is to create a safe and supportive environment where everyone can thrive.</p>

          <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">“Therapy taught me that seeking help is a strength, not a weakness.”</p>
          <p>John was a high-achieving student who always seemed to have it all together. But behind closed doors, he battled severe anxiety that made even the simplest tasks overwhelming. For years, he kept his struggles hidden, fearing judgment from others. <br><br>

            One day, after a panic attack left him unable to leave his room, John decided to seek help. With the support of a therapist, he began to understand the root of his anxiety and learned techniques to manage it. Through therapy, he realized that asking for help wasn’t a sign of failure but a brave step toward healing. <br><br>
            
            Now, John openly shares his journey, encouraging others to prioritize their mental health. He has become an advocate for therapy and mental health education, inspiring those around him to seek support without fear.</p>

          <h3>Emma's Journey: Turning Pain into Purpose</h3>
          <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">“Becoming an advocate gave me purpose and hope for the future.”</p>
          <p>Emma grew up in a family that believed mental health issues were something to "snap out of." Struggling with depression during her teenage years, she often felt isolated and misunderstood. Her lowest point came during her first year of college when she thought she couldn’t go on. <br><br>

            A compassionate professor noticed the signs and referred her to the university’s counseling center. The sessions were life-changing. With professional guidance and support, Emma began to rebuild her self-esteem and rediscover her passions. <br><br>
            
            Today, Emma is a mental health advocate who speaks at schools and community events. She uses her story to break the stigma surrounding mental illness, showing that recovery is possible and that no one should suffer in silence.</p>

          <h3>Raj's Experience: The Power of Community Support</h3>
          <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">“Community support was the lifeline I didn’t know I needed.”</p>
          <p>Raj had always been the "life of the party," but beneath his cheerful exterior, he struggled with bipolar disorder. The highs and lows took a toll on his relationships and career, leaving him feeling isolated and hopeless. <br><br>

            One evening, while browsing online, he stumbled upon a local mental health support group. Nervous but desperate for connection, Raj decided to attend a meeting. What he found was a safe space where he could share his experiences without fear of judgment. <br><br>
            
            The support group became a lifeline for Raj, helping him understand that he wasn’t alone in his struggles. With encouragement from his peers, he sought professional treatment and developed strategies to manage his condition. Raj now leads the same support group that changed his life, offering hope and guidance to others navigating their own mental health journeys.</p>

          <h3>Simone's Experience: Overcoming the Pressure and Prioritizing Mental Health</h3>
          <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">“I knew that I had to put my mental health first. It was a tough decision, but one I don't regret.”</p>
          <p>Simone Biles, one of the most decorated gymnasts in history, made headlines during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics when she withdrew from several events to focus on her mental health. <br><br>
          Simone faced a mental health challenge known as the "twisties," a dangerous condition where gymnasts lose spatial awareness mid-air. This condition is a serious risk in a sport that requires immense precision. By stepping back, Simone not only protected herself but also started an important conversation about the need for athletes—and people everywhere—to prioritize their mental health over external pressures. Her story has empowered others, especially those in high-stress professions, to take their mental health seriously and seek help when needed.</p>

          <p>Carrie openly discussed her struggles with bipolar disorder, addiction, and the challenges she faced while navigating the entertainment industry. <br><br>

            She became a champion for mental health, using her platform to share her story and break down the stigma surrounding mental illness.

          <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">“I found that with depression, one of the most important things you can realize is that you’re not alone.”</p>
          <p>In interviews, he has shared that, despite his success and fame, he faced severe depression during his teenage years and later in life. At one point, he even contemplated suicide after a series of challenging life events. <br><br>
